The Cojen/Maker library is a dynamic Java class generator which is primarily focused on ease of use. Other popular class generation libraries expose the low-level details of the JVM architecture, but this knowledge isn't a prerequisite when using the the Cojen/Maker library. The trade-off is somewhat slower performance when generating bytecode, but the performance of the resulting code is identical when running with a modern JVM.
